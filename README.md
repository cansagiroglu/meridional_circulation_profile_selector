Modelling the Magnetic Activity in the Sun and Sun-Like Stars
Visualization of the Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Inside the Convective Envelope with Meridional Circulation

Context. To investigate the physical nature of the magnetohydronamic flow that influences the dynamo processes of the magnetic activity cycles in G-type-main-sequence stars like the Sun by producing graphical outputs of various meridional circulation profiles.

Aims. This study aims to show the difference between various meridional circulation profiles, their respective flow vectors and how they recycle throughout the convective interior of a G-tpye-main-sequence star, specifically the Sun. This prooved to be an important aspect of modelling the magnetic activity cycle since the dynamo process relies heavily on the transportation of convective fluids inside the convective envelope.

Methods. I use Python 2.7.15 programming language to compute the meridional circulation profiles, their respective meridional flow vectors and produce their graphical output to lay the ground for an analysis of their radial and angular dependence and how they might effect the stellar dynamo.

Results. Hemispheric radial and angular distribution of meridional circulation behaviour is dictated by the exponent of the stratified convective zone m, amplitude for the surface and subsurface return flow p and amplitude of rising and sinking flow at lower and higher altitudes signifying the radial dependence q. Strength of the flow is dictated by the amplitude of the flow u0
